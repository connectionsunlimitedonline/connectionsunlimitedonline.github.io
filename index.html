                                                    Connect 4 is played on a vertical grid with 7 columns and 6 rows. Players take turns dropping their colored discs into any column of their choice. The disc will fall to the lowest available position in that column. The objective is simple yet engaging: be the first to connect four of your discs in a row - horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game requires careful planning and strategic thinking, as each move can either lead to victory or create opportunities for your opponent.

                                                    Success in Connect 4 requires mastery of several key strategies. Control the center columns, as they offer the most opportunities for connections. Create multiple threats simultaneously to force your opponent into defensive moves. Watch carefully for diagonal opportunities, as they're often the most overlooked. Block your opponent's three-in-a-row formations while building your own winning positions. Advanced players should think several moves ahead and avoid placing discs that might help their opponent create a winning move.

                                        The game begins with an empty 7x6 grid, presenting players with a clean slate full of possibilities. Each column offers different strategic advantages, with the center positions being particularly valuable for creating winning opportunities. The first move often sets the tone for the entire game, making it crucial to start with a well-thought-out strategy.

                                        The opening move is crucial in Connect 4. Many experienced players opt for the center column, as it provides the most opportunities for creating winning combinations. This strategic choice allows for both horizontal and diagonal connections while maintaining flexibility for future moves. The first player's choice of column can significantly influence the flow of the game and the available options for both players.

                                        As the game progresses, the complexity increases with each move. Players must balance offensive opportunities with defensive necessities. Creating multiple threats simultaneously becomes crucial, forcing opponents to make difficult choices. Watch for diagonal connections, as they often provide surprise winning opportunities. Strategic placement of discs can create "double threats" - situations where blocking one winning move creates another.

                                        The game reaches its climax when a player successfully connects four discs in any direction. Victory can be achieved through careful planning and strategic placement, whether through a straight horizontal line, a vertical stack, or a diagonal connection. The winning combination is highlighted to celebrate the victory and help players learn from the successful strategy. Understanding common winning patterns is key to both achieving victory and preventing opponent wins.

                                    Successful Connect 4 strategy involves several key principles:<br />
                                    • Control the center columns, especially the bottom center position, as it provides the most opportunities for connections<br />
                                    • Look for diagonal connections, as they're often overlooked by opponents and can lead to surprise victories<br />
                                    • Create 2x2 blocks to threaten multiple directions simultaneously<br />
                                    • Force your opponent's moves by creating multiple threats that require immediate attention<br />
                                    • Develop a strong understanding of "threat space" - areas where winning connections could potentially be made<br />
                                    • Practice thinking several moves ahead to anticipate and counter opponent strategies<br />
                                    • Use defensive moves to block opponent's winning opportunities while setting up your own

                                    New players often make several common mistakes that can be easily avoided:<br />
                                    • Ignoring diagonal threats from opponents, which can lead to unexpected losses<br />
                                    • Placing discs beneath opponent's potential winning moves, inadvertently setting them up for victory<br />
                                    • Focusing too much on attack while neglecting defense, leaving themselves vulnerable<br />
                                    • Not planning connection paths in advance, limiting their strategic options<br />
                                    • Overusing edge columns, which limit development options and make it harder to create winning combinations<br />
                                    • Failing to recognize patterns that could lead to forced wins<br />
                                    • Not thinking about how their moves might help their opponent<br />
                                    • Overlooking the importance of controlling the center of the board
